                    This game is a public war.  <br /> 
                    Please listen carefully.  <br />
                    In this war, today's players cannot see the battlefield, <br /> as 
                    the outcomes of battles are set <b>in the near future</b>. <br /> 
                    Using the Vision Orb, players can see the accurate prediction of the future. <br /> 
                    If the forecast looks favorable, a side can send the command to execute kills [in the future]. <br /> <br />
                    However, the player will never see their kills from the present, and must be certain not to take any actions based on outdated forecasts. <br /> 
                    The history of the battles in this great war will be recorded in the Sacred Timelog. <br /> 
                    There are no rules to this game or specifications on how to play it. <br /> 
                    All potential exploits of game mechanics are encouraged. <br /> 
                    Coordinate with your allies and use the weapon of time to your side's advantage. <br />
