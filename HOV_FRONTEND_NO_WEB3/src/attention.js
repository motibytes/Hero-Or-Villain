            No person should interact with this website or the Hero Or Villain smart contract before reading the disclaimer, 
            the 'rules of war document', and the user should strongly understand the potential dangers of this technology and the full risks it carries.<br />

            A user with no technical aptitude have no business interacting with this site. <br /><br />
            A user of this site is expected to have a fair understanding of the inherent risks involved in blockchain technology.<br />
            <br /> 
            This project involves cryptocurrency, and is connected to a contract deployed on the Polygon blockchain. <br />
            Interaction with the functions in this project involves real 'fake internet magic money', e.g. CRYPTOCURRENCY, tied to real money.  <br />
            The Creator takes no responsibility for any at all, any at all losses or damages from the use of this unaudited, experimental contract. <br />
            The user should understand that this website is just a front-end to interact with the Hero or Villain Solidity Smart contract.<br />
            The user should completely understand before using this contract that there is no financial incentive to participate in this social experiment whatsoever. <br />
            The user of this contract should understand that the Creator does not themselves completely understand what they are doing. <br />
            The user of this contract should indeed be expected to read about and understand what they are doing. 
            That is to say that the user should, unlike in the 1900's, be expected to have a fair level of technical aptitude in interacting with crypto projects. <br /> 
            This is to say again that a user with no technical aptitude has no business interacting with this site. <br />
            <br /> 
            Do not interact with this website for the sake of monetary gain. This was not designed to give you money. <br />
            Do not interact with this website for the sake or hopes of monetary gain. There is none. <br />
            Do not interact with this website for the sake or hopes of or dreams of monetary gain! There is none. <br />
            Do not consider interaction with this smart contract to be financially lucrative. It is not.  <br />
            If you find a way to make money from this website, congratulations, you are most likely a time traveler from the future. I Am not responsible for your gains either.<br /> 
            You should understand that the creator a.k.a. developer has monetized this project and that use of the 'buy Level' functions pay a fee to the developer. <br />
            You should understand that the contract was written with the functionality to use special functions that integrate, 1. 'Keys' 'NFTS' and 2. 'Allies' 'NFTS', 
            thereby potentially giving a [not very practical] use case to a speculative asset. 
            <br /> <br />
            If you lose money, that is, suffer unintentional losses by interacting with this project, people will laugh at you.<br />
            <br /> 
            If you intentionally lose money by interacting with this project in the hopes that you can scam me by trying to get me to give you money, people will laugh at you in court. 
            After they are done laughing, I will laugh at you, but not in a 'ha ha' funny way, but in a very angry and maniacle way. 
            <br />            <br />

            Basic Rundown: <br />
                In the functionality of this smart contract is the capability of integrating with 'NFTS' as well as other smart contracts, 
                in which a user's possession of the NFT would allow them to use special functions, and thereby potentially giving value to the NFT. 
                However it doesn't really make sense for that because the NFT will not help you win this game, in the sense that winning usually means concluding, and this game does not end. 
                Anyone who reads the rules of this game should understand that it does not entirely make sense. 

                The Creator is very concerned about getting into any sort of legal trouble and has absolutely no interest in any illicit legal 'shenanigans'. 
                I keep it clean.
                <br />
            <br /> LEGAL: <br /><br />
            The Creator insists that "warning and attention" is a sufficient header to catch the attention of the incompetent.<br />
            The Creator is not a legal professional. <br />
            The Creator Wishes to express that while he may seem extremely competant, he is, in fact, not. <br />
            The Creator wishes to express their intentions for the user to be fully cognizant of their responsibility in interacting with this website, <br />
            and by no means wishes to overcomplicate the text with confusing jargon, or overwhelm the user with technicality and mass.<br />
            The Creator wishes to express that there is no desire for a user to 'accidentally' use this site. <br /> 
            The Creator also desires to express that this project was not created for incompetant people, it was actually created for me because I wanted to create something.<br /> 

            The Creator desires to express that the reason a warning is not posted 'above' the work is that this is indeed, a work, and is presented exactly as it was designed to be presented. 
            
            The Creator insists that the current difficulty of moving funds onto the polygon blockchain, and has installed 'Metamask' and found their way to this page is not technically incompetant, is highly literate, and should be expected to gain an understanding of this technology. 
            <br />
            The Creator insists that the user i. should be appropriately warned by this notice, i.i. should not be confused as statements are repeated several times with different and basic verbage, i.i.i. if incompetant should be reasonably expected to run away in a simple emotional response upon reading the words 'critical warning and attention', 
            iv. should not be overwhelmed by the amount of text in this notice as it is written in an 'entertaining' and 'engaging' tone. 
            <br />
            Finally[yes, finally], the creator wishes to express that there are multiple parts to this tech and project and the creator does not know the outcome of all of this stuff. 
            The creator doesn't have any concrete plans for monetization, and this writing shouldn't be expected to cover every possibility to be disclaimed because that is over my head. In all honesty I have no control over whether a project like this will take off or not. Such a possibility would be considered in the realm of 'miraculous'.
            In truth, the creator is a researcher who used the creation of this project to learn about servers and coding languages and website infrastructure.  
            <br />
            I insist that it is reasonable for me as a creator to launch an uncertain project now at a critical time in history in which this technology is becoming highly popularized and explored.
            <br />
            I insist that if I didn't create what I ought to create, i think i'd fade away.
