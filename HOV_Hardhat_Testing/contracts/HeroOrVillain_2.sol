    Public Domain Release Update: 
    On 1/7/2024 I release all claim to this code, that it be available to the public domain. 
    By the power of the Word as is mine by Divine Right, I declare that anyone who attempts to use this code with malicious intent or any evil purposes will crumble. Their project will not work and the results will return to sender. 

    @notice HERO OR VILLAIN is not audited or financially insured in any way. Interaction with this contract is entirely at your own risk. 
    @notice There is no financial gain or financial incentive for the user and no reason at all to invest money into this gamified contract. 
    @notice 
    
    Hero Or Villain is a smart contract on a blockchain that is decentralized with public functions, 
    meaning that this is a project that anyone can participate in. 
    This is a game and social experiment allowing anyone to support either side. 
    At its core, players level up the power of their side by calling a function that rises their strength stat, 
    and if one side can overpower the other, the opposing side enters a vulnerable state in which the stronger side can execute kills. 
    
    The game's logic affects the game on a more advanced level. For example, it would require some coordination for a team to operate effectively. 
    This is because if a team were to raise their strength stat too high, the weaker side could actually gain kills instead! 
    A multiplayer game with anonymous players makes the tactics involved to remain the stronger force is unprecedented. 
    Another consideration is that rising the strength stat of the opposing team could actually work in your team's favor. 
    Yet another consideration is how transactions function on the blockchain itself in relation to time. 

    How this game will perform on the blockchain is unknown even to the developer. 
    After deployment, there is no developer control over the core of the game or ability to shut it down. 

    A sample of the game's logic: 

    if hero is greater than villain * 2 
    hero kills villain 
    and if hero is greater than villain * 4 
        then villain * 8
        if villain is greater than hero * 2 
            then villain kills hero
    
    @notice 
                        - HERO OR VILLAIN 2 -  

    I.    The 'resolved' state of the game is peace. 
    II.   This game is a public war with two public sides. 
    III.  The 'rise' function increases your side's strength by current level.
    IV.   The side with more power is 'winning'. 
    V.    Power is calculated by [strength * level] + [support / 1000].
    VI.   Player's total contributions to each side are saved as love points. 
    VII.  Payable LevelUp functions will add one level to your chosen side. 
    VIII. Player can run visionOrb() to find out the current results without writing state changes, requiring no gas. 
    IX.   executeKill() will calculate and write the outcome of the game: 
        i. If one side's power is 2 times greater than the other, the greater side will gain one kill. 
        ii. The fallen side will resurrect, and their level will rise to equal the level of the opponent. 
        iii. If one side's power is 4 times greater than the other, the opposing side will be supported by supernatural power with a x8 multiplier. 
        iv. If the former side's power is any greater than the opposing side with the x8 multiplier, the opposing side will die. 
        v. If the side with the x8 multiplier's power is 2 times greater than the opposite side, the opposite side will die. 
    X.    A player can play both sides. 
    XI. All potential exploits to game mechanics are encouraged. There are no rules in war. 
   
    XI. 'Metagame' 'Ready Player X' Functions: 
        i. If player pays fee for setLevel() functions, players team will permanently level up [affecting 'rise()' function interactions of all players]
        ii. If [an nft ally contract exists and ] the player's address holds an nft from the ally contract, 'rise()' functions will multiply added strength by 4. 
        iii. If [a nft key contract exists and] the player's address holds an NFT "Key" from the contract, player can call 'Use_Key()' functions, 
        waiving fee and permanently leveling up player's team [affecting 'rise()' function interactions of all players]
    
    This work is considered finished and complete as is. Future versions of this game adding additional weight and functionality are a strong possibility. For all updates see @0xdivi on twitter. 
    
    Thank You for Playing!
